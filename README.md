# pyGameEngine
Created by Buddhima Zoysa on 27th of April 2020

Dependancies : Just pygame module (to install pygame just run "pip install pygame")

This is just a wrapper to pygame module (https://www.pygame.org) that provides funcionality like One Lone Coder's olcPixelGameEngine.h (which you can find here https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine)
This may not be perfect I actually don't use python that often so there may be so many bugs and bad programming
If someone find this useful go ahead download it experiment with it (And this only tested on windows)
Good luck :)
P.S. Sorry for my Bad English
